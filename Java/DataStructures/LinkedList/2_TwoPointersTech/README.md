# Two Pointer Technique

## Using two-pointer tech:
1. Two pointers starting at different positions
    - only works for doubly linked list
2. Two pointers moved at **different speed**
    - also called "**slow-pointer and fast-pointer problem**"
    - ideas is that if the track was straight, fast-pointer will stop at the end. But if the track was a circle, fast will catch up slow-pointer.
